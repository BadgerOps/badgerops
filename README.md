### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here's a bunch of random repos that have built up over time. Some are useful, some I just can't bring myself to delete.

I hope something here is helpful, feel free to hit me up on twitter [@badgerops](https://twitter.com/badgerops) or [mastodon.social/@badgerops](https://mastodon.social/@badgerops) if you have any questions/comments.
